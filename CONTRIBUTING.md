# Welcome!

We are looking forward to changes and improvement to this package. Before you
contribute, please read the [Code of Conduct][CoC].

[CoC]: https://github.com/EcoJulia/SimpleSDMLayers.jl/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

## Repository structure

- `src` contains all the functions, types, and methods
- `tests` contains the unit tests and some integration tests
- `docs` contains the documentation
  1. please use `julia docs/_weave/make.jl` to update the webpage and the README
  2. the notebooks go in `notebook` (also compile them, and update the README)

## Don't know where to start?

- report a *bug* or suggest an *improvement* -- open an [issue] on *GitHub*
- write a *vignette* -- used `GBIF.jl` to do something? Put a Jupyter notebook in `docs/notebooks`, and add it to the README
- improve the *documentation* -- all functions have a `docstring` where they are declared, and improving them is a great way to get started

## Workflow

This section describes the general steps to make sure that your contribution is
integrated rapidly. The general workflow is as follows:

1. Fork the repository (see *Branches, etc.* below)
2. Create an *explicitly named branch* from `develop` (if present) or `master`
3. Create a pull request *even if you haven't pushed code yet*
4. Be as explicit as possible on your goals
5. Do not squash / rebase commits while you work -- we will do so when merging

### Pull requests

Creating a pull request *before* you push any code will signal that you are
interested in contributing to the project. Once this is done, push often, and be
explicit about what the commits do (see commits, below). This gives the
opportunity for feedback during your work, and allow for tweaks in what you are
doing.

A *good* pull request (in addition to satisfying to all of the criteria below)
is:

1. Single purpose - it should do one thing, and one thing only
2. Short - it should ideally involve less than 250 lines of code
3. Limited in scope - it should ideally not span more than a handful of files
4. Well tested and well documented
5. Written in a style similar to the rest of the codebase

This will ensure that your contribution is rapidly reviewed and evaluated.

### Branches, etc.

The *tagged* versions of anything on `master` are stable releases. The `master`
branch itself is the latest version, but it *must* always work (after the first
tagged release). For more intensive development, use the `develop` branch, or
feature-specific branches. All significant branches are under continuous
integration *and* code coverage analysis.

### Versioning

We use [semantic versioning][sv] (`major`.`minor`.`patch`). Anything that adds
no new feature should increase the `patch` number, new non-API-breaking changes
should increase `minor`, and major changes should increase `major`. Any increase
of a higher level resets the number after it (*e.g*, `0.3.1` becomes `1.0.0` for
the first major release). It is highly recommended that you do not start working
on API-breaking changes without having received a go from us first.
