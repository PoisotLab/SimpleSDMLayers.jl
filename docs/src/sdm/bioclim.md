# Writing BIOCLIM from scratch

In this example, we will write the BIOCLIM species distribution model using
`SimpleSDMLayers.jl` and `GBIF.jl`.

```@example bioclim
using SimpleSDMLayers
using GBIF
using Plots
using StatsBase
using Statistics
```

We can get some occurrences for the taxon of interest:

```@example bioclim
serval = GBIF.taxon("Leptailurus serval", strict=true)
obs = occurrences(serval, "hasCoordinate" => "true", "continent" => "AFRICA", "decimalLongitude"=>(-30,40))
while length(obs) < 240
    occurrences!(obs)
end
```

This query uses a range for the longitude because despite restricting the
continent to Africa, some invalid records make it through (this is a GBIF
problem, not a package problem). Before we get the layers, we will figure out
the bounding box for the observations - just to make sure that we will have
something large enough, we will add a 2 degrees padding around it:

```@example bioclim
left, right = extrema([o.longitude for o in obs]) .+ (-5,5)
bottom, top = extrema([o.latitude for o in obs]) .+ (-5,5)
```

With this information in hand, we can start getting our variables. In this
example, we will focus on variables related to temperature:

```@example bioclim
predictors = worldclim([1,2,3,4]; left=left, right=right, bottom=bottom, top=top)
```

The point of BIOCLIM (the model, not the dataset) is that the score assigned to
a pixel is maximal is this pixel is the *median* value for a given variable -
therefore, we need to measure the cumulative density function for every pixel in
every variable.

```@example bioclim
_pixel_score(x) = x > 0.5 ? 1.0-x : 2.0x

function SDM(layer::T, observations::GBIFRecords) where {T <: SimpleSDMLayer}
    qf = ecdf(layer[observations]) # We only want the observed values
    return (_pixel_score∘qf)
end
```

Note that we use the ∘ (`\circ`) operator to chain the quantile estimation and
the pixel scoring, which requires Julia 1.4. This function returns a *model*,
*i.e.* a function that we can broadcast to a given layer, which might not be the
same one we used for the training.

The next step in BIOCLIM is to get the *minimum* suitability across all layers
for every pixel. Because we have a `min` method defined for a pair of layers, we
can call `minimum` on an array of layers:

```@example bioclim
function SDM(predictors::Vector{T}, models) where {T <: SimpleSDMLayer}
    @assert length(models) == length(predictors)
    return minimum([broadcast(models[i], predictors[i]) for i in 1:length(predictors)])
end
```

The advantage of this approach is that we can call the `SDM` method for
prediction on a smaller layer, or a different layer. This can allow us to do
thing like stitching layers together with `hcat` and `vcat` to use
multi-threading, or use a different resolution for the prediction than we did
for the training.

```@example bioclim
models = [SDM(predictor, obs) for predictor in predictors]
prediction = SDM(predictors, models)
```

Just because we may want to visualize this result in a transformed way, *i.e.*
by looking at the quantiles of suitability, we can call the `rescale!` function:

```@example bioclim
rescale!(prediction, collect(0.0:0.01:1.0))
```

This map can be plotted as we would normally do:

```@example bioclim
plot(prediction, frame=:box, clim=(0,1), c=:davos)
scatter!([(o.longitude, o.latitude) for o in obs], ms=4, c=:orange, lab="")
xaxis!("Longitude")
yaxis!("Latitude")
```

This model is not impressive *at all*, but this is an illustration of the ways
we can use the functions from SimpleSDMLayers to build pipelines.
