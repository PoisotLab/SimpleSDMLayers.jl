# Working with GBIF data

In this example, we will see how we can make the packages `SimpleSDMLayers` and
[the `GBIF.jl` package](https://ecojulia.github.io/GBIF.jl/dev/) interact. We
will specifically plot the relationship between temperature and precipitation
for a few occurrences of the kingfisher *Megaceryle alcyon*.

```@example temp
using SimpleSDMLayers
using GBIF
using Plots
using StatsPlots
temperature = worldclim(1)
precipitation = worldclim(12)
```

We can get some occurrences for the taxon of interest:

```@example temp
kingfisher = GBIF.taxon("Megaceryle alcyon", strict=true)
kf_occurrences = occurrences(kingfisher, "hasCoordinate" => "true")

# We will get some more occurrences
for i in 1:9
  occurrences!(kf_occurrences)
end

@info kf_occurrences
```

We can then extract the temperature for the first occurrence:

```@example temp
temperature[kf_occurrences[1]]
```

Of course, it would be unwieldy to do this for every occurrence in our dataset,
and so we will see a way do it much faster. But first, we do not need the entire
surface of the planet to perform our analysis, and so we will instead clip the
layers:

```@example temp
temperature_clip = clip(temperature, kf_occurrences)
precipitation_clip = clip(precipitation, kf_occurrences)
```

This will make the future queries a little faster. By default, the `clip`
function will ad a 5% margin on every side. To get the values of a layer at
every occurrence in a `GBIFRecord`, we simply pass the records as a position:

```@example temp
histogram2d(temperature_clip, precipitation_clip, c=:viridis)
scatter!(temperature_clip[kf_occurrences], precipitation_clip[kf_occurrences], lab="", c=:white, msc=:orange)
```

This will return a record of all data for all geo-localized occurrences (*i.e.*
neither the latitude nor the longitude is `missing`) in a `GBIFRecords`
collection, as an array of the `eltype` of the layer.

We can also plot the records over space, using the overloads of the `latitudes`
and `longitudes` functions:

```@example temp
contour(precipitation_clip, c=:YlGnBu, title="Precipitation", frame=:box, fill=true)
scatter!(longitudes(kf_occurrences), latitudes(kf_occurrences), lab="", c=:white, msc=:orange)
```

These extensions of `SimpleSDMLayers` functions to work with the `GBIF` package
are meant to greatly simplify the expression of more complex pipelines, notably
for actual species distribution modeling.

## DataFrames support

Note that both `SimpleSDMLayers.jl` and `GBIF.jl` offer an (optional)
integration with the `DataFrames.jl` package.
Hence, the example above could also be approached with a `DataFrame`-centered
workflow.

For example, after getting occurrences through `GBIF.jl`, we can convert them
to a `DataFrame`:

```@example temp
using DataFrames
kf_df = DataFrame(kf_occurrences);
last(kf_df, 5)
```

We can then extract the temperature values for all the occurrences:

```@example temp
temperature[kf_df]
```

Or we can clip the layers according to the occurrences:

```@example temp
clip(temperature, kf_df)
```

We can also export all the values from a layer to a `DataFrame` with their
corresponding coordinates: 

```@example temp
temperature_df = DataFrame(temperature_clip);
last(temperature_df, 5)
```

Or do so with multiple layers at the same time:

```@example temp
climate_clip = [temperature_clip, precipitation_clip]
climate_df = DataFrame(climate_clip);
rename!(climate_df, :x1 => :temperature, :x2 => :precipitation);
last(climate_df, 5)
```

We can finally plot the values in a similar way:

```@example temp
filter!(x -> !isnothing(x.temperature) && !isnothing(x.precipitation), climate_df);
histogram2d(climate_df.temperature, climate_df.precipitation, c=:viridis)
scatter!(temperature_clip[kf_df], precipitation_clip[kf_occurrences], lab="", c=:white, msc=:orange)
```
