## Simple Layers for Species Distributions Modelling

**What is this package**? `SimpleSDMLayers` offers a series of types, methods,
and additional helper functions to build species distribution models. It does
*not* implement any species distribution models, although there are a few
examples of how this can be done in the documentation.

**Who is developping this package**? This package is primarily maintained by the
[Quantitative & Computational Ecology][qce] group at Université de Montréal, and
is part of the broader EcoJulia organisation.

**Can I sponsor this project**? Sure! There is a link in the sidebar on the right.
Any money raised this way will go towards the snacks and coffee fund for students,
or any charitable cause we like to support.

**How can I cite this package**? This repository itself can be cited through its
Zenodo archive ([`4902317`][zendoi]; this will generate a DOI for every
release), and there is a manuscript in *Journal of Open Science Software*
describing the package as well ([`10.21105/joss.02872`][jossdoi]).

[jossdoi]: https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.02872

**Is there a manual to help with the package**? Yes. You can read the
documentation for the current [stable release][stable], which includes help on
the functions, as well as a series of tutorials and vignettes ranging from
simple analyses to full-fledged mini-studies.

[stable]: https://ecojulia.github.io/SimpleSDMLayers.jl/stable/

**Don't you have some swanky badges to display**? We do. They are listed at the
very end of this README.

**Can I contribute to this project**? Absolutely. The most immediate way to
contribute is to *use* the package, see what breaks, or where the documentation
is incomplete, and [open an issue]. If you have a more general question, you can
also [start a discussion]. Please read the [Code of Conduct][CoC] and the
[contributing guidelines][contr].

**How do I install the package**? The latest tagged released can be installed
just like any Julia package: `]add SimpleSDMLayers`. To get the most of it, we
strongly suggest to also add `StatsPlots` and `GBIF`.

**Why are there no code examples in this README**? In short, because keeping the
code in the README up to date with what the package actually does is tedious;
the documentation is built around many case studies, with richer text, and with
a more narrative style. This is where you will find the code examples and the
figures you are looking for!
