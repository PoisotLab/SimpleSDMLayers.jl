## Simple layers for Species Distributions Modelling

This package offers very simple types and functions to interact with
bioclimatic data and the output of species distribution models.

### Type system

All types belong to the abstract `SimpleSDMLayer`, and are organised in the
same way: a `grid` field storing a matrix of data (of any type!), and the
`left`, `right`, `bottom`, and `top` coordinates (as floating point values).

The two core types of the package are `SimpleSDMPredictor` and
`SimpleSDMResponse`. The only difference between the two is that predictors
are immutable, but responses are.

### Methods

Most of the methods are overloads from `Base`. In particular, `SimpleSDMLayer`
objects can be accessed like normal two-dimensional arrays, in which case
they return an object of the same type if called with a range, and the value
if called with a single position.
