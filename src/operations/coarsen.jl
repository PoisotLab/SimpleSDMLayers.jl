    coarsen(L::LT, f::FT, d::Tuple{IT,IT}; NaNremove::Bool=true) where {LT <: SimpleSDMLayer, FT <: Function, IT <: Integer}

This function will *aggregate* a layer by merging cells. The function `f` passed
as its second argument is expected to take an array as input, and return a
single value of the same type as the values of the layer, or as a floating point
value. Note that the element type of the returned layer will have type `Any`,
which is not really pretty, but should serve well enough (and can be changed by
working on the `grid` field directly if you really need it).

The size of the cells to aggregate is given by the tuple, so that `(2,2)` will
make groups of two cells vertically and two cells horizontally, for a total of
four cells.

The `NaNremove` keyword argument is intended to remove `NaN` values before
applying `f`. It defaults to `true`.
